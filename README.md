# ChessEngine

A fully functional Chess Engine implemented in C++ that allows users to play chess with a computer opponent. This engine includes a user-friendly interface, move generation, board evaluation, and more, following the rules of standard chess.

## Features

- **Move Generation**: Supports all legal chess moves, including castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.
- **Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Provides an AI opponent that can evaluate board positions and select the best possible moves.
- **Board Evaluation**: Evaluates positions based on material balance and other positional factors to make strategic decisions.
- **Two-Player Mode**: Allows users to play against the engine or a human opponent.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Provides a simple interface for playing chess visually.
  
## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Itachi0906/ChessEngine.git
    cd Game1/src
    ```

2. Compile the project (assuming you have a C++ compiler installed):
    ```bash
    g++ -o chessengine main.cpp -std=c++17
    ```

3. Run the Chess Engine:
    ```bash
    ./chessengine
    ```

## How to Play

- Once the engine starts, you can choose to play against the AI or another player.
- Click the piece which you want to move then select the square where the piece should be placed.
- The AI will calculate and make its moves based on the current board state.
